# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011

**Introduction**

Bird strikes are collisions between birds and aircraft, posing significant risks to aviation safety and causing economic costs. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bird strikes from 2000 to 2011 using data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights.

**Objectives**

Analyze trends in bird strike occurrences over the years.

Identify seasonal and monthly patterns.

Map geographical hotspots for bird strikes.

Examine the altitudes and types of aircraft involved.

Identify the bird species most commonly involved in strikes.

Assess the severity and damage caused by bird strikes.

**Data Sources**

The data used in this project comes from Unified Mentor

**Data Preparation**

Data cleaning and preparation steps include:


Removing duplicates and handling missing values

Standardizing formats for consistency

Ensuring data integrity

**Analysis and Visualization**

The analysis involves:

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Summarizing main characteristics and identifying key patterns.

*Data Visualization*: Using time series plots, heat maps, bar charts, and geographical maps to present data insights.

**Tools and Libraries**

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

Python: For data analysis and visualization

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations

Google Colab: For interactive data analysis and visualization
